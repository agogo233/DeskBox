/// <summary>
/// Fills raster and SVG image sources for mutable widget asset files
/// (per-widget backgrounds, title icons, shared backgrounds) through a
/// file stream. The framework's URI-keyed image cache has no eviction
/// API and serves the first decode for the whole session, so loading a
/// re-picked asset by URI would keep showing the previous image even
/// after a reset deleted and rewrote the file — stream-loaded sources
/// stay out of that cache entirely. Unlike
/// <see cref="GlanceImageStreamLoader"/> there is no URI fallback here:
/// widget asset files rewrite one fixed name, so a URI load would
/// resurrect exactly the stale decode this loader exists to avoid.
/// Failures are reported through <paramref name="settled"/> so callers
/// degrade to their fallback layer instead of keeping a blank surface.
/// Call on the UI thread; the awaits deliberately keep the captured
/// context so SetSourceAsync stays on the source's thread.
