/// <summary>
/// The stack popover lives in the TOPMOST band (StackPopoverHostWindow pins
/// it at construction), but WinUI shows every FlyoutBase in its own
/// "Microsoft.UI.Content.PopupWindowSiteBridge" window that stays in the
/// normal band — owned by the widget window, not the popover. A menu opened
/// from the popover therefore renders beneath it and cannot be clicked
/// (live-captured 2026-10-21: the bridge pair is an ~80px icon-strip window
/// plus a ~300px row-area window, and owner-following z transactions on the
/// widget can additionally strip the popover's own topmost bit, which made
/// the failure look intermittent between old and new stacks). While a
/// popover-hosted flyout is open, every visible bridge of this process is
/// lifted into the topmost band and dropped back when the menu closes. A
/// short poll covers submenu bridges, which get their own window and no
/// Opened hook the host could attach to.
